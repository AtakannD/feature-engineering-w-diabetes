**Feature Engineering with Diabetes Patient**


1. Business Problem

It is desired to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether people have diabetes when their 
characteristics are specified. You are expected to perform the necessary data analysis and feature engineering 
steps before developing the model.


2. Story of Dataset

The dataset is part of a large dataset held at the National Institutes of Diabetes-Digestive-Kidney Diseases 
in the USA. Data used for diabetes research on PimaIndian women aged 21 and over living in Phoenix, the 5th largest 
city of the State of Arizona in the USA. The target variable is specified as "outcome"; 1 indicates positive 
diabetes test result, 0 indicates negative.


3. Variables of Dataset

Pregnancies: Number of pregnancies
Glucose: 2-hour plasma glucose concentration in the oral glucose tolerance test
Blood Pressure: Blood Pressure (Smallness) (mm Hg)
SkinThickness: Skin Thickness
Insulin: 2-hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
Diabetes Pedigree Function: A function that calculates the probability of having diabetes according to the ancestry.
BMI: Body mass index
Age: Year
Outcome: Have the disease(1) or not(0)


Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis

Task 2: Feature Engineering

	Step 1: Taking necessary actions for missing and outlier values.
	Step 2: Creating new variables.
	Step 3: Executing the encoding operations.
	Step 4: Standardizing for numeric variables.
	Step 5: Creating the model.
